# Setting Up the Bank Project on Apache with Ubuntu
# I am assuming you know how to setup apache.

Follow these steps to get the project running on your Ubuntu server using Apache:
## 1. Install Apache and PHP

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y

sudo apt install mariadb-server -y

# Make sure to create a secure root password
sudo mysql_secure_installation


sudo mariadb -u root -p
# Import the dataschema from the static folder in the repository *bank.sql*
```

# Setting up Apache

- Define document root and give neccesary permissions
- Apache config path: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
